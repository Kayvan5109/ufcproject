If he goes to market, I think the Heat are on that list. I don’t know if they have enough. A lot of their offer would be built around Tyler Herro, who’s just injured. But I suspect, I don’t know for sure, just to be clear, I don’t know for sure that they would offer him, but I would suspect that that would be the type of thing, that and draft picks.\n\nhttps://hoopshype.com/2023/04/26/miami-heat-on-the-list-of-potential-damian-lillard-trade-suitors/"

I don’t see why people don’t think he can be consistently efficient in his prime. He’s 24. \n\nIn the playoffs, if he’s willing his team to wins and using his gravity to pull 2 guys in with some of the shots he’s takes, I don’t see the big difference between him and other stars having average efficiency with volume numbers. \n\nNot saying his shot selection isn’t horrible sometimes but I think the “inefficient” narrative is overstated."

        "body": "Currently both NBA and Euroleague playoffs are on and watching NBA games after Euroleague is really painful. Now, I am not talking about quality of basketball of course, NBA has much better players. Also, I wont discuss the way the game is played in both competitions. I am talking about pure enjoyment of watching basketball. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst problem NBA has is horrible refereeing. There is literally no set criteria on what will be called as foul, not between different games but also between different moments inside a game. In Euroleague, refs allow players to play harder, not every contact is called for a foul, especially if an attacker is not close to scoring or making a scoring play. This allows the game to flow and rhythm of the game is uninterrupted. Foul criteria is different with different referees, but it is usually consistent during the game. Of course, there are missed calls and similar stuff but at Euroleague level that goes both ways. In NBA every little contact wherever it is on the court can be called as a foul and it usually is. Flow of the game gets broken every couple of possessions. \n\nSecond problem is a huge number of free throws NBA teams shoot. This is not necessary due to referees, its due to differences in how bonus is counted, with last 2 minutes of each quarter every team foul after second one are automatic FTs. NBA teams commit 3.1 foul less then Euroleague teams (adjusted for 40 minute games 16.6-19.7) but at the same time they shoot 1.3 FTs more (19.6-18.3). These stats are kind of weird, since NBA game is much more focused on 3PT. Also number of fouls NBA teams make is quite small when we look at the difference in pace (15% higher in NBA). But still if feels like there are to many breaks.\n\nThird, and probably the biggest problem is amount of breaks during the game. Free throw shooting takes like forever. Every time it is called you have to wait for player to get to the line, often there will be some substitutions which take time, they get to shoot first FT and then another pause for the second one. It feels as long as a timeout. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how can the league fix this? Well they should probably change the FT rules. Have a bonus at 5th foul each quarter without the last two minutes rule. Teams should use fouls carefully and they can be a valid part of the strategy in different parts of the game. \n\nAlso, they should do a complete overhaul in ref department. Things got out of hand long time ago with referees becoming key participants in games, instead of  just being \"invisible\" on the side doing their job. Favoring different teams and players while having basically public feuds with others is insane. Taking revenge on players for their comments which hurt ref's egos and favoring players which talked positively about them. The league seem to not have problem with this as long as their money making players and teams get to advance. Hope this AI development will lead to refs being replaced with some automated program, but im not sure the league would like to lose influence over results. \n\nI understand there are differences in the way both leagues are run. NBA, like rest of US sports, is about show, entertainment and most importantly maximizing their profit. Games have to last certain amount of time with as many commercials as possible. The biggest stars should have the decisions going in their favor more often then not. The problem is that the true spirit of sport is being lost."

Everyone plays hard and handles adversity. Westbrook can be brought back using the $3.8 million non-Bird exception, and Mason Plumlee can be re-signed with his Bird rights. But the Clippers could shake things up, too, with a handful of tradable expiring contracts (Marcus Morris, Nicolas Batum, Covington, Gordon) that can be attached to their own first-round picks in 2028 and 2030, plus six future second-round picks. Consolidation can be a cure.\n\n> Ty Lue remains one of the best coaches in the league, but it’ll be interesting to see if he’s around next season—by his own choice or as an undeserved fall guy. If not, Nick Nurse makes sense as a replacement, particularly through his experience of coaching Leonard (and Powell) to a championship in 2019.\n\n> Back then, the Clippers were coming off a first-round defeat against the Warriors. Today, George and Leonard are still one of the top pairings in the league, more than talented enough to lead the Clippers to a title in 2023-24. But the clock is ticking. Neither star is getting any younger, and the financial burden Ballmer is about to endure has no precedent in pro sports.

When healthy you would essentially ensure that all star players are playing, nobody would rest during this run and thats all we want, make the games competitive.\n\nThats my rant of the day, I think its a no brainer.\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* This would mean there would be 31 picks in the first round, the team that would normally get 15th would get 16th, and so on.

        "body": "Are the suns really a “superteam”? I see this label thrown around, usually by non Suns fans, probably to inflate expectations for them. They really don’t look or feel like a super team like the KD Warriors or the KD/Harden/Kyrie Nets. The Suns might have a really good record with KD playing, but they don’t look anywhere near as dominant as those Warriors and Nets teams did when fully healthy. I don’t think the Suns are even championship favorites. At least the Warriors and Nets super teams were definitely favorites to win their conference and/or the title. \n\nWhy do people keep calling the Suns a super team? Is it because they have 3 big name stars? Is it because people want to gas them up so that, if they lose, they can be made fun of more?"

Like yesterday they were down 16 with 7:25 left in the 4th and made a huge run to cut the lead to 2 with a 1:25 left in the 4th. In the entire series clips really showed the suns weakness; their role players aren’t good and are inconsistent. They lack rim protection or any elite defenders. Chris Paul isn’t the same and has regressed as a shooter and defender. He’s still An above average pg but he isn’t the same as we has 2 years ago. But the suns biggest issue is that they somehow take their foot off the peddle and crumble big leads down starches . Seriously kd and booker have been otherworldly but the suns role players have been disappointing. The suns aren’t a for sure bet to make the nba finals that some catered them to be post kd trade.

Offense was arguably worse as they couldn't figure out how to make KAT productive for a few games, along with taking too long to make Ant have the lionshare of the playmaking. There were so many stretches of forced and stagnant possessions that even the Nuggets players looked bewildered. It was also so difficult for the Wolves to get out into transition to make up for their flacid half court sets. Perhaps it's difficult to get out in transition with the twin anime towers.\n\nHowever, there is so much upside to this team if they can figure out a few things:\n-Ant NEEDS to build trust with Gobert. Yes, Gobert has feet for hands, but if he can get the reps during the season, him and Ant would be an unstoppable force. No, not in the PnR, but with Gobert as a lurker in the paint as Ant gets downhill. Ant's athleticism would allow him to react at the last moment to finish the drive if Gobert's man doesn't commit, or dish it to Gobert if he does. With Conley in the corner, KAT popping off a pick, and Jaden a double threat as a shooter or cutter, defenses will always be forced to make a sacrifice. \n-KAT needs to move without the ball better to open up more opportunities for himself. He clearly cannot establish position on the block, no matter if it's Giannis or Bruce Brown. He can shoot it anywhere on the court. No floaters or those drives he does where he looks like a newborn baby deer. Just shoot where he stands. If he has the defense's 5 on him, then he can drive. Shoot over everyone else. \n- There is no reason the Wolves should be this bad at rebounding. It's inexcusable. Yes, KAT gets drawn out more by the 4, which may indicate that he's been overrated as a rebounder, just was in the paint on defense until this year. Rudy shouldn't be having to deal with multiple opponents for rebounds as much as he does. Wolves need to figure out how to establish better presence on the glass. \n-KAT is horrible at passing out of the double teams, but he is a legitimately good passer. Obv this can be better exploited in the half court, but where he is criminally under utilized is as an outlet passer. Get Ant and Jaden to fly down the lines and hit them over half court. \n\nAs their roster stands now, the Wolves core rotation next season would be: Conley/Slomo, Ant/NAW, Jaden/Prince, KAT/Naz, and Gobert. With a season under their belt together, their chemistry will be much improved next season along with better understanding of their offensive and defensive systems. \n\nMIN finish 3rd in the West for 2023-24."

        "body": "First of all, Suns do have crazy talent with their top 4. There are some things the Clippers exploited.\n\n1. Booker and KD don't really look to pass to each other. Their assist to turnover ratio hasn't been great in the playoffs. Clippers just lost Kawhi/PG and couldn't get deflections off their passes without playing guys like RoCo. Key is to force them to drive then hard double off Ayton or Craig. Ayton is pretty soft so a guard can cover him on rotation \n\n2. Clippers almost came back because they ignored KD some but mostly Ayton. Clippers stuck Russ on Ayton which disrupted all pick and rolls with him. The best play probably would be to feed Ayton in the post. But that's just not Suns basketball. If I was the Nuggets, I would stick Murray or MPJ on Ayton. He's soft.\n\n3. Jokic should be able to feast on Ayton and KD. They lack any post defense. CP is a good ball hawk to watch out for. Jamal Murray should also try to post up CP and Booker. I think the offense will be fine against the Suns. Clippers scored efficiently without Kawhi or PG.\n\n4. Biyombo - Clippers didn't exploit him enough when he was on the court. Powell drew a few fouls on him. Biyombo can't guard the perimeter, so let Murray cook Biyombo on switches. Biyombo also has no offensive game. So just hard trap if he sets picks. Foul him if he tries to dunk. He shot 35% from FT in regular season. \n\nThat's all. Booker played well this series, but Clippers didn't have a Bruce Brown to tag on him. I predict Nuggets in 6.\n\nI think it would be Suns in 7 if they change the offensive scheme to be KD-centric. For example, Suns focus on getting KD his high post mid range shots off screens. Run pick and roll between KD and Booker. How is that play never run much?"

They were able to capitalize on Milwaukee's weaknesses before, and here they are doing it again.

It has hurt a fan base that increasingly looks back at the 2019 team, the one outside of and in between the Lob City and 213 mirror, as the last enjoyable and consistently reliable Clippers team — one that also lost in the first round to a Pacific Division team featuring Kevin Durant. And it has hurt the top Clippers fan of all in Ballmer, who has to decide how his front office and coaching staff will go about the potential final year of the 213 era, one that has won three postseason series in four years.\n\n[Source](https://theathletic.com/4451459/2023/04/26/kawhi-paul-george-clippers-era/)"

The PnR between Giannis and Brook was the only consistent, reliable source of offense last night, as their total pts and assists were not a fluke. The Heat had as little a response to them as the Bucks had to Jimmy.\n\nAnd as time ran down and the lead persisted, Giannis as a playmaker and Brook as the main offensive threat were wrung out of the gameplan, as Jrue and Middleton were given the task of \"closing\" the game out. \n\nAn issue thats reoccurring all season has been this team's inability to close out a game after gaining a lead. ESPECIALLY in the crunch. Too often have they lead by as many as 20pts before turning into the least disciplined team on the court. Throwing the ball away, offensive fouling, stepping out of bounds with the game in their hands, picking up techs due to temper flair ar the refs, lazy rebounding, horrendous shot selection, and icing out its main star.\n\nThe perception that Giannis is not \"clutch\" and that the game must be closed by Middleton is a old perception. As Giannis has greatly improved as a playmaker since 2019 and the Bubble, so too has he improved as a clutch performer and closer. And yet the ganeplanning ALWAYS defaults to icing him out of a game almost entirely until something has gone wrong and they need him to regain the lead when things are too late.\n\nAdd on to this Bud's absolute refusal to double Jimmy Butler while leaving Khris Middleton on an island, obviously unable to stop Jimmy. And in the span of having a 12pt lead cut down to tying it that a timeout wasn't called. Bud watched a 12-0 run pass him by. And out of timeout calls for one Giannis possession before letting his players once again ignore him as they take the ball up.\n\nHonestly, this series, or even this game alone is how people lose a job no matter of competence. And I think it's where a lot of Bucks fans are leaning right now"

However, unlike the MVP award, the winner of the Brownlow is decided by the umpires (or “referees”), who confer after every game and award 3 points, 2 points, and 1 point to the players they decide were the best, second best, and third best performers respectively. Then, at the end of the season, the points are tallied and revealed at an end-of-season awards ceremony where the eventual winner is crowned. Personally, I think this is an excellent system and thought I’d apply it to this year’s playoffs.  \n\n--\n\nA couple of things to note: https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/12u3ggn/oc_snypers_nba_playoffs_brownlow/ \n\n1. As is true of Adam Silver, once finished, all evidence of the play-in tournament is wiped from my memory. \n2. As the total number of games played will inevitably vary from player to player, after every round scores will be averaged (total score/no. of games played).\n3. As an avid fan of both the NBA and RPGs, I understand the value of high availability and luck stats. So, whether through injury, suspension, or shark attack, absences will not be accounted for regarding the number of games played. For example, although Kawhi Leonard missed games 3 & 4, his total score will still be divided by 4. \n  \n--\n\nBelow, you'll find a table with the scores awarded for each game.

Before getting himself ejected for a **second** seperate taunt on Embiid, Claxton might've been the most impactful player on the court. He was finishing well, anchoring the Net's defence, and doing everything and anything he could to bother Embiid into a subpar performance. Harden, too, was the 76ers' most consistent threat before he was ejected for a nut-tap on Royce O'Neal. In my opinion, both ejections were soft, but rewarding ejected players who couldn't contribute in the 4th quarter doesn't sit well with me. So, by default, the 3rd place point goes to Tobias Harris, who had a solid two-way performance and came through when the Sixers needed someone to step up. \n\nG) 3rd place came down to Durant and Westbrook. Durant posted a 28/5/6 stat line to go along with 2 steals while shooting 53/33/100 splits. Westbrook posted a 30/12/8 stat line with 3 steals and a block while shooting 49/43/83 splits. They were both a +1 on the night. They both had 6 turnovers. Westbrook might've pipped Durant on the offensive end, but despite the flashiness of Westbrook's defence Durant has the edge on that end of the floor. Durant was relatively quiet in the 4th quarter, while Westbrook's play was loud but a mixed bag. It's a toss-up, but to the victor goes the spoils. \n\nH) Even with Morant dropping 45 points in his return, more than half those points came in the 4th quarter, by which point the outcome had already been decided. \n\nI) I don't care that it came in a loss. Westbrook was the best player on the floor, and he was the biggest reason why Phoenix need all three of their stars to show out. \n\nJ) This is a weird one. Trae Young gave the sort of all-encompassing performance that, to be frank, the Celtics didn't/haven't needed from their superstars in Tatum and Brown. In fact, the Celtics have been so superior that they haven't even needed to mercilessly hunt Young on defence, which again works in the diminutive guard's favour for an individual award like this one. Hurray for Young?"

I heard Joe Harris who can’t make a shot in the playoffs for whatever reason.\n\n> But you look at the Cavs, they don’t have any first round picks to trade. They traded them all for Donovan Mitchell. They literally cannot trade a first round pick. They have some extra seconds, but they’re like Warriors seconds and other seconds. They don’t have much fungible salary that anybody wants. They’re also only a million dollars under the tax, so the easiest way to make your team a little bit better on the margins – which is all they need – is like, who wants to cut money? Who wants to give us a decent player and to cut your tax bill? They can’t even do that.\n\n> I’m sure there must have been some move they could’ve done. There’s always some move you can do, I just don’t know what it was. I know they were looking around at wings at the middle, bottom of the barrel.

        "body": "[This is a very interesting read](https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article274680506.html) about the nature of the injury and possible outcomes for Fox. Kobe had an avulsion fracture to his finger  (similar to De'Aaron Fox's)  in 2009 and played through it. I know Kobe had an almost obsessive need to compete but I have to wonder if Fox will be able to play through the injury.\n\nThe guy scored 38 in the last game. That's one point shy of the Kings' second and third leading scorers combined (Murray and Monk with 23 and 16 respectively). I realize the Warriors struggle on the road but, without Fox to draw attention from the defense, they don't have a shot.\n\n>Stotts explained that avulsion fractures in the fingertips occur when one of the muscles that anchors to the distal phalanx pulls away a small piece of the bone. Stotts noted that such injuries “result in different deformities based on the muscle involved, specifically mallet finger for an extensor injury and jersey finger for a flexor injury.” According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), most mallet finger injuries will heal with nonoperative treatment over a period of eight to 12 weeks, even when treatment is delayed up to three or four months. However, a jersey finger diagnosis requires surgical treatment and generally means eight to 12 weeks of inability to compete in most contact sports. A mallet finger injury usually results from an axial or jamming force directed at the fingertip while the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) is in active extension. A jersey finger injury usually results from forced hyperextension of the DIPJ, often while a player is grasping the jersey of an opponent who quickly pulls away. The Kings have not disclosed the exact nature of the injury, but it occurred with 4:35 to play in the fourth quarter when Warriors center Kevon Looney swatted at a layup attempt in a downward motion, striking the tip of Fox’s finger. Fox remained in the game to score seven of his 38 points on a pull-up jumper, two free throws and a clutch 3-pointer in the final minute. The apparent jamming impact from Looney might suggest a mallet finger injury for Fox. **According to the NIH, return to sport is allowed after eight to 12 weeks of treatment. However, the NIH notes, “competitive athletes are generally reluctant to the loss of play” and “for a mallet finger, a few weeks of delay in treatment may be acceptable if the athlete is in a critical phase of the season.”**  \n>  \n>Stotts noted that a number of players have played through index finger fractures, including Roger Mason Jr. and Kobe Bryant**. “Bryant’s situation is particularly interesting as he suffered the injury twice, once in 2009 and again in 2010,” Stotts wrote. “He played through the injury in 09 and missed just a pair of games the following season. Kobe wore a splint on the injured digit for the entirety of Los Angeles’ run to the 2010 title.”**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead more at: [https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article274680506.html#storylink=cpy](https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article274680506.html#storylink=cpy)"

The sixers are interesting because even though they are the better team than the Heat, they have some humiliating loss like the Hawks series. Not to mention Harden and Doc’s playoff history that comes into question along with Embiid’s healthy. I think Heat can beat the sixers but not the Celtics personally but what do y’all think."

He often relies on stepback 3s (which I don't remember that ever being a specialty of his) or pull-up 3s in transition (which I also don't remember ever being his calling card).\n\nKhris Middleton is a little older, and becoming a little more injury prone. Furthermore, when I think of championship #2's all time and in the current league, I would say he's on the lower end (which I know is a weird thing to say as an indictment). Plus, I know it's a meme, but unless it was against the Celtics, has he ever had a full series of \"number 2 on a championship team\" level play against a contender in the playoffs? I backed off my critisms of him after they won the championship and maintained being a contender, but I've never felt that he was THE fit for Giannis as the number 2.\n\nCoach Budenholzer's criticisms are well known at this point, and with this series, it is no different. Miami's 3 point makes, and overall offense, has exploded, and there has been no attempt to double or really pressure Miami's lone offensive star in Jimmy Butler. Furthermore, on offense the team went away from the 4-5 pick and roll that was dominating in the second half of game 4, and instead went to isos that lead to stepback 3s and contested midrange fades.\n\nShould the Bucks move on from any of those 3, should a better option become available? \n\nIs it possible that it wouldn't matter and Giannis is the main reason for these problems, since he is also a common denominator in these loses (while I thought he played great today, he did have 6 turnovers and scored on 54% true shooting)?"

Both are willing to do whatever it takes on both ends of the floor, both seem at times to be the hungriest players in the NBA. Both will either take the last shot or find the right last shot for their teams and when the game is on the line they have both proven time and time again they have that big game/late game/postseason magic. \n\nJust curious to hear who everyone else thinks the IDEAL no. 2 (or no. 1) would be to pair with Lebron in his current state.\n\nEdit: roster construction, coaching etc. aside but I do feel like stuff like personality/mentality or the whole “playing with Lebron” thing should definitely be factored in. That’s why I wouldn’t consider players like Steph, KD etc. They would clearly be an unstoppable combo from an Xs and Os standpoint and their games would obviously mix beautifully, but could they even coexist?"

But this was the worst playoff game of his career by far and his worst game as a Bucks.\n\nTerrible shot selection and honestly just did not do enough against Butler on a historic night. I keep thinking back to the one possession where he wasted a majority of the shot clock standing around, then tried to post up Kyle Lowry from the three point line, only to then turn the ball over leading to Butler going to the line\n\nJust an absolute disaster class from one of the league's highly respected two-way players"

His doing so is Boston's best bet to re-sign him before his current contract expires and appreciably boosts the odds he stays with the only franchise he's known for at least the next few years.\n> \n> Beyond Brown, as detailed when the Celtics removed the interim tag from Joe Mazzulla, Udoka brought most of the current coaching staff to Boston. Many of the team's assistant coaches share Oregon roots with him, and it'll be interesting to see if and how many join Udoka in Houston.\n\nhttps://www.si.com/nba/celtics/top-stories/rockets-hire-former-celtics-head-coach-ime-udoka"

Lebron has played in a grand total of 269 (and counting) playoff games, which is over three seasons worth of games, and averages 28.7 PPG. The closest active player to Lebron's playoff point total is Kevin Durant, who is at 4670 in 159 games played. If Lebron were to never play another playoff game, KD would need to play 104 more playoff games scoring at his playoff average of 29.4 to pass Lebron. The most amount of games a player can play in a singular playoffs is 28, so if every series KD played from here on out went to 7 games and he made the Finals each year, he'd need to play for another four years at his current level to pass Lebron\n\nIn the regular season, Lebron James has 38652 points. The closest active player is again Kevin Durant (technically Carmelo Anthony, but he's not on a roster) with 26892. If Durant were to play all 82 games each season and score at his career PPG of 27.3, he would pass Lebron in 6 seasons, assuming Lebron doesn't play another regular season game. \n\nPersonally, I think Lebron's playoff point total is the harder record to break. With sports and medical science continually making advancements, I think it will be possible for players to have 20+ year careers and eventually, someone will play long enough and a high enough level to pass Lebron in regular season scoring. But when it comes to playoff scoring, I don't see a way in which someone is going to make 8 straight Finals and play in every single playoff game during that stretch. Lebron has never missed a playoff game in his 20 year career, whereas other players like Giannis and Luka have already missed multiple playoff games. And with the talent level at an all time high, it's hard to imagine a player running a conference for nearly a decade."

Obviously this is all still speculation since we aren't sure the actual lottery order, but assuming the draft order itself stays the same what do you guys think?  For myself the only team I can feasibly see trading down or out of the top 10 is Portland and that is only if they try to make something happen and bring in more vets or immediate impact players to try and make a last push with Dame.  Maybe like a future pick\"s\" and Bogdonovich from Detroit or something similar.  Obviously they are going pick Wemby if they grab the first, but if they are still sitting at 5 I could see them making a move out. \n\nWas also thinking OKC would be a team that could realistically package together a few picks to jump up because at this time I think their core is solid and right now I believe they would be more interested in quality over quantity of picks.  But I'm not sure who they could trade with since most teams in the top 10 right now are really looking to pick up good young talent. And I don't know if they have anyone that they'd want to part with, nor should they part with, that Portland would be interested in.  Any player that's good enough right now to warrant interest from Portland is probably young enough to be part of their future for the next number of years."

So Lue and Westbrook need to realize that. \n\nLue needs to sub them out if they are broke. Westbrook needs to make a mental adjustment like Kobe would and not pass them the ball. Westbrook should have told Morris and Powell they are on full-time duties to set picks so Westbrook can drive in for layups. Make Morris and Powell run Horns. Westbrook also has to make those adjustments and force those guys if they are playing to just set picks and not look for their shot.\n\nGame 5 should just be do or die Westbrook with 40+ FGA.

Of course he can't stop him outright, but I can see the Celtics playing Muscala for about 10-15 minutes a game to commit hard Fouls on Embiid, frustrate him, and get into his grill. Embiid is a very emotional player, so Muscala will be put out their to tamper with his emotions, and the Nets while they got swept, shows that this strategy works in limiting the ability of Embiid. \n\nSo will Mike Muscala be key in this (likely) match-up?"

Yeah, I know Dame may not be with us much longer, but that has been discussed ad nauseum and I'm not here to debate that. We have an exciting young guy to build around in Shaedon Sharpe and he definitely has star potential, but he showed no indication of being clutch this season. In fact, there were a few occasions that he seemed to shrink from the moment when he had a chance to be clutch. He is only 19 years old, which makes this somewhat understandable, but I remember Dame being clutch from day one. Is clutch a thing that can be honed or developed over time or is it something you're just born with?"

        "body": "We all know that no NBA team has overcome an 0-3 deficit in the playoffs before. Let's broaden the lens a little bit to examine 0-3 deficits in all major North American sports that use a best-of-seven playoff format.\n\n**NBA**\n\nIn the NBA, all playoff series currently use a best-of-seven format, with a 2-2-1-1-1 split, though this was not always the case. The NBA Playoffs officially began in 1950, though earlier records are counted by the league. In 1950, with three divisions, they had a confusing system where all teams participated in a divisional semifinal and divisional final (best of 3 series), and then the top team would advance straight to the NBA Finals, while the two others competed in a semifinals matchup (also best-of-3). The only best-of-seven series that year was the NBA Finals.\n\nNot until 1958 were the Divisional Finals expanded to best-of-7 series, and divisional semifinals were not expanded to best-of-7 until 1968. The 16-team NBA Playoff format that we are familiar with today (which scrapped divisional matchups and moved straight to 1-8 seeding in each conference) did not come into effect until 1984. Round One was Best-of-5 until 2003.\n\nSince then, slight tweaks have been made regarding how seeding is determined for divisional champions, and in 2016, divisional titles became totally meaningless, but the basic premise has not changed since 1984.\n\nIn that time, there have been 148 instances of a team taking a 3-0 series lead, and not once has there been a team to pull off the Reverse Sweep. Here's the exact breakdown:\n\n- 51 of these 3-0 leads occurred in Round 1 (only possible starting in 2003, so that makes sense)\n\n- 48 occurred in the Conference Semis\n\n- 25 occurred in the Conference Finals\n\n- 14 occurred in the NBA Finals\n\n- 6 occurred in the old Divisional Finals (became a 7-game series in 1958; stopped existing in 1984)\n\n- 3 occurred in the old Divisional Semis (became a 7-game series in 1968; stopped existing in 1984)\n\n- The 1947 Semifinals also featured a 3-0 lead - Stags defeated Capitols in 6.\n\n- The sweep has been completed 91 times (61.5%)\n\n- The series wrapped up in five on 43 occasions (29.1%)\n\n- The series wrapped up in six on 11 occasions (13.5%)\n\n- A Game 7 has been forced just 3 times. The teams to have forced Game 7 after trailing 0-3 are: 1951 Knicks (vs. Royals in Finals), 1994 Nuggets (vs. Jazz in WCSF), and 2003 Trail Blazers (vs. Mavs in Round 1).\n\n**Major League Baseball:**\n\nMLB has a much longer history than the NBA, but its playoff format has also changed greatly over time. The National League and American League joined up in 1903 to heave each of their respective champions play each other in what they called the World Series.\n\nThere were other \"World Series\" that teams would play prior to this, but as they were often unregulated, MLB does not recognize the outcomes of these contests as official. The first official World Series was a 9-game series (the Boston Americans beat the Pittsburg Pirates in 8 games), and there was no World Series in 1904, as the New York Giants believed the American League to be inferior and refused to play them.\n\nStarting in 1905, the World Series has existed as a 7-game series (MLB briefly tried the 9-game series from 1919-1921, but decided to retun to 7 games in 1922), and has been played every year except 1994, when the season ended due to a players' strike because of labor disputes. From 1905 to 1968, the team in each league with the best record was proclaimed the League Champion and went to the World Series.\n\nIn 1969, four more teams were added to MLB, and this created an unequal schedule, as teams played more of the teams in their region than they did in other regions. This necessitated the creation of 2 divisions within each league, and they created a League Championship Series where the top team in each division would play for the League Pennant. Originally a 5-game series, the LCS's were expanded to 7 games in 1985.\n\nIn 1994, the leagues split into three divisions a piece, necessitating another playoff expansion - the League Division Series. Now all three Division Champs in each league would play in the postseason, as well as the non-division-champ with the best overall record. This is a best-of-5 game series.\n\nAnother Wild Card team was added to each league in 2012, with the next-best two teams playing in a 1-game playoff to determine the 5-seed, and the Division Champs with the best overall record in each league automatically advancing to the LDS.\n\nIn 2022, a third wildcard team was added to each division, where the top two division winners automatically advance to the LDS, and the 3rd division, as well as the three wild card teams, all compete in a best-of-3 series.\n\nOnly the World Series and LCS's are best-of-seven series.\n\nThere have been nine instances of a team gaining a 3-0 lead in the ALCS since 1985.\n\n- The sweep was completed on 6 occasions.\n\n- The series was wrapped up in 5 games once.\n\n- A Game 7 was forced on one occasion - 2020 ALCS. Rays gained a 3-0 lead over the Astros, the Astros faced a Game 7, but the Rays won. This does have an asterisk, as all 7 games were played at a neutral site.\n\n- **The 2004 Boston Red Sox completed a reverse sweep of the New York Yankees and ultimately swept the St. Louis Cardinals to win the World Series**\n\nThere have been seven instances of a team gaining a 3-0 lead in the NLCS since 1985.\n\n- The sweep was completed 4 times.\n\n- One series went 5 games\n\n- Two series went 6 games.\n\nTeams have taken a 3-0 lead in the World Series on 24 occasions (not including 1903 or 1919-1921):\n\n- The sweep was completed 21 times (1907 and 1922 both ended in 4-0-1 results, back when games were able to end in a tie)\n\n- Three series went 5 games.\n\n- No team has ever forced even a Game 6 in the World Series after being down 0-3, let alone a Game 7.\n\n**NHL**\n\nThe NHL started in 1917 and first used a 7-game playoff series for the Stanley Cup Finals in 1919 before moving away from it the following year. They did not return to a best-of-seven series until 1939. In 1943, they expanded the semifinals to a best-of-seven series too, though there were only 6 NHL teams at the time.\n\nThe league doubled in size in 1967, and split into two divisions, though the playoff format itself remailed largely unchanged. In 1974, six more teams were created, so NHL was split into two conferences of two divisions - each division winner got byes to the Conference Semifinals, while the 2nd & 3rd place team in each division would play a best-of-3 series. All other series were best-of-7.\n\nIn 1979, the league expanded again and changed the playoff format once more - 16 teams would now compete in the postseason - the preliminary round was a best-of-5 series while all others were best-of-7. This was minorly tweaked in 1982 to return divisions to the mix. 1987 saw the Divisional Round also expand to a best-of-7 series.\n\nIn 1994, the Playoffs were redesigned in a similar way to the NBA playoffs - 8 teams from each conference with a traditional seeding. The only difference is that seeding was reevaluated in each round. Minor tweaks have been made since then but they have remained a 16-team playoff with 8 teams from each conference and all series being best-of-7.\n\nThe NHL has several more instances of teams coming back from 3-0 deficits than the other two leagues.\n\n**Teams that have forced Game 7 (but lost) after being down 0-3:**\n\n- 1939 Rangers (vs. Bruins in Semifinals)\n\n- 1945 Red Wings (vs. Maple Leafs in Stanley Cup Finals)\n\n- 1975 Islanders (vs. Flyers in Semifinals)\n\n- 2011 Blackhawks (vs. Canucks in Conference Quarterfinals)\n\n- 2011 Red Wings (vs. Sharks in Conference Semifinals)\n\n**Teams that completed the Reverse Sweep:**\n\n- 1942 Maple Leafs in Stanley Cup Finals (vs. Red Wings)\n\n- 1975 Islanders in Quarterfinals (vs. Penguins)\n\n- 2010 Flyers in Conference Quarterfinals (vs. Bruins)\n\n- 2014 Kings in Round 1 (vs. Sharks)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere have been 5 teams to complete a reverse sweep in a 7-game series in North American sports. Additionally, a Game 7 has been forced but lost on 3 occasions in the NBA, 5 in the NHL, and once in MLB.\n\nWhile MLB is the oldest sport on the list, it only had one playoff series until 1969, and the LCS's did not expand to best-of-seven until 1985, so there have only been 189 total best-of-7 series in baseball. This is the smallest sample size of the three.\n\nNHL has by far the biggest sample size here, as they began using a best-of-7 format in 1939 and began using it for multiple series each year in 1943, so we get a slightly truer idea of how likely it is that we'll see a team pull it off one day in the NBA."

In 2002-03, there were two 30+ ppg scorers and four guys with 27+ ppg. In this season, there was only one 28+ ppg scorer and the 2nd highest scorer had a measly 24.2 ppg.\n* Tmac had a massive lead at the top of the leaderboards. He was never as dominant a scorer before or after. Peja Stojakovic and Baron Davis also had career seasons.\n* The three previously mentioned guys attempted 6.5+ threes a game. This is the first time anything close to this happened with a non-shortened 3 point line. And other scoring wings like Kobe, Pierce, and Arenas had a noticeable bump in their 3PA in the seasons afterwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas this season a preview that a 3 point revolution was the natural consequence of legalizing zone defense? Coaches adjusted their gameplan and star guards/wings started shooting more 3s after this season, which may be why the low individual scoring didn't last long. Tmac also didn't have a crazy dominant season as a scorer akin to this one, showing how he was truly ahead of its time. \n\nThe tactical adjustment from the coaches to just get their best slashers to shoot more 3s to open up the lane rather than rely on elite shooting talent as the first option also demonstrates a resistance to change imo. The stars the fans wanted, the stars their gameplans were built around were usually not elite shooters around this time. So, it took a true primarily 3 point shooting global superstar i.e. Curry to stop this resistance and let nature run its course. In that sense, Curry didn't start this revolution as much as he broke the dam that was holding the wave of change back."

Maybe it has to do with how much power guys like Greeny/Stephen A/Wilbon have where they want to cover the NBA but they refuse to travel as much so that forces them to run separate crews?

Or to some people, top 50, he’s a loser that’s “an above average starter”. Yes, I’ve actually seen that said multiple times recently. \n\nTrae since his second season:\n\n19-20: 29 and 9(APG)on 44/36/87-all star starter, criminally underrated season because he was constantly compared to Luka. \nKeep in mind he was 21 years old \n\n20-21: 25 and 9 on 44/35/88, led the Hawks to the ECF at 22 years old. \n\n21-22: This is where things get weird. Hawks  start off 17-25, due to INJURIES and COVID at that time. Once they get back relatively healthy, they go 27-13 to end the season and Trae Young has his best season: \n\n28 and 10 on 46/38/90, leads the NBA in total points and assists. Hawks are 44-38 to end the year. \n\nIs somehow regulated to All-NBA 3rd team due to Hawks record even though that didn’t have much to do with him. \nWe all know what happened in Miami after that. This led to the Hawks trading for Murray\n\nNow, you can tell nobody has watched the Hawks all season because Trae is just always the issue with the team somehow no matter what he does. \n\nHe did start out the season terribly shooting 41% from the field and 28% from 3 in the first 23 games of the year. \nSince that point he got back to around his usual stats, 26 and 10 on 44/36/88 with massively improved defense the rest of the year but it didn’t matter. \n\nNobody has talked about how terrible of a coach Nate McMillan was, the Hawks are still recovering from the bad habits they developed with him. \n\nNobody is looking at how Dejounte doesn’t compliment Trae like how he was supposed to and how his defense has not been great this year and his scoring has been inefficient through stretches. \n\nNobody is looking at how terrible the spacing has been in the starting lineup all year mainly because of John Collins and Deandre Hunter not playing up to standard. These guys are fed mostly open shots and they still brick most of the time. \n\nAnd then the defense, people realize the Hawks defense is bad even when Trae is OUT OF THE GAME, right? \n\nThe Hawks have talent but by trading Kevin Huerter, Gallo, Delon Wright, and losing Lou Will, Solomon Hill, they’ve lost depth, shooting and vet experience. \n\nThe roster is a bunch of talented players who don’t fit together, especially in the starting lineup at least. \n\nTrae is not in the best position to succeed with Atlanta right now, replace him with most star players and you’d see the same results. \n\nBut because Trae is small, and people like to root against him, he’s been unfairly treated for a while now. \nHeard nothing but crickets after his 32,6 and 9 game last night. \n\nI hope this stops next year. Trae is one of the most offensively gifted players this league has ever seen and he’s not even in his prime yet."

This series is showing they really need a starting Wing and a viable bench if they want to compete in the postseason. \n\nTrading Darius Garland could be a way for the Cavs to fix these issues. Cleveland might consider it because his skillset ultimately overlaps too much with Donovan Mitchell - and Donovan is way better with the ball in his hands than Garland is. Garland essentially turns into a catch and shoot guy on offense while not doing anything on defense - you can find a bunch of those guys for a tenth of the price.  \n\nHowever as a young All-star, he has a lot of trade value, meaning the Cavs could get more value from him by trading for him than continue to play him. They can trade him for an average starting PG (who would have the same role on offense) and a really good starting wing, and maybe some protected picks to rebuild their trade assets. \n\nThoughts? Or is a Garland - Mitchell the backcourt to build around and the Cavs should consider trading Jarrett Allen instead?"

        "body": "Kawhi was announced to be out in G4 earlier today and based on his history, he may not be available for the entire series.  Meanwhile, PG is ramping up but it seems also unlikely for him to play in the crucial G4.  The undermanned Clippers played some spectacular basketball in G3 and with Ty Lue as their head coach, you can never count them out even with their two 2-way superstars are out.  I was rewatching the highlights of the three games and would like to discuss the way forward for this team in G4.\n\n**Westbrook's leadership and offensive performance**\n\nRuss has been playing extremely well in this series and put the team on his back in G3 with a near triple double.  His athleticism is still the best in the entire series and noticeably he played a much better defense, both team wise and individual wise, even against stars like Booker and KD.  The key to G4 is his three ball and mid range, as they opens up the lane for his drives and dunks since defenders have to respect his outside shooting.  This current Clippers team with him as the leader is the perfect scenario for him to flourish and rehab his reputation for the summer.  Expect him to snatch a triple double with average efficiency will be a reasonable expectation for his G4 performance.  \n\n**Eric Gordon has to step up and stop being passive in offense**\n\nWhen Kawhi was announced out in G3, although it is widely expected that Norman Powell to step up, but I didn't expect Eric Gordon to be this passive.  He only got 7 points with 6 shots.  While his defense has been declining this series, he still has a great three-ball and is a good ball handler when he is tasked to drive and kick the ball or hit some tough layup.  With this roster, Eric Gordon has to step up in G4 and play like the Houston Rockets style, where CP was out and he and Harden literally shouldered the team's offense against the Warriors in 2018 WCF.\n\n**Small ball is good when Ayton is passive, but please play more Robert Covington**\n\nTy Lue is a phenomenal coach who can raise the floor easily.  He dared to play a super micro ball with 5 guards down the stretch in G3 since Ayton is literally non-existent on both sides.   But Robert Covington getting only about 4 minutes of action is just unacceptable.  He plays the 5 well back in Houston, has respectable three ball and good defense, especially team defense.  Let him play like Draymond Green as the 5 and as the safety net of the team.\n\n**Plumlee should see less than 8 minutes per game, while Zubac has to be very careful with his ball handling**\n\nPlumlee was relentlessly targeted by CP in PnR and got lost in defensive assignment.  He should only be used as someone for fouls.  Based on what I have remembered, there's at least 2 instances where Zubac was trying to do dribble handoff and Booker just stole his ball easily.  He has to be more conscious about the surroundings and minimizes doing a lot.  Just focus on getting rebounds and set good screens to free your shooter.\n\n\\-\n\nWelcome all of you to supplement more and discuss G4 of the series."

I feel like this would reduce the amount of injuries and pain players feel when they fall on certain plays. It’s not like it interferes with players’ decision-making because it’s out of bounds anyway. Perhaps it might even make them play harder and make faster drives and riskier moves to the rim due to the fact that you know that even if you fall you won’t be hurt as much. I get that courts change and differ due to varying events that take place in the facility but the amount of effort and money it requires seems negligible compared to the benefits it would have. \n\n\nWatching Anthony Edwards just fall out of bounds sparked the question.
